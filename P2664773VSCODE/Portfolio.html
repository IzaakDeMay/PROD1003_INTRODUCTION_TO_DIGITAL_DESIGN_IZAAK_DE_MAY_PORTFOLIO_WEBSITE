    <!-- Below is the JavaScript code that goes alongside where you can view the portfolio work. This code makes
    sure that the filtering element works properly. 
    
    The first section of the JavaScript (the section with Filter Selectio (All) at the beginning) makes sure that 
    the filtering element works and displays all the content within the div elements above, regardless of class. 
    The show element within the w3RemoveClass element makes sure that other elements are hidden when not selected.
  
    The next section of the JavaScript (the section that begins with function w3AddClass(element, name) at the beginning)
    is the code to help display the filtered elements once selected. This mean that once a specific button is pressed, this 
    section of JavaScript makes sure that only that filtered element is shown. 
  
    Below that in the next section (the second function w3RemoveClass <element, name) will make sure that once the specific 
    element (for example if photography is selected) is selected, that all the other non selected elements are hidden.
  
    The final section at the bottom of the JavaScript code is for the buttons in the portfolio which filters the content. This 
  JavaScript code activates the class makes sure it does its correct function. -->
